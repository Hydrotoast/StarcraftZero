Starcraft Bronze
----------------

This game is a reduced form of Starcraft Zero. We restrict the units to Drones,
Overlords and Zerglings. We restrict the buildings to Hatcheries and Spawning
Pools. The objective of the game is reach over 150 Zerglings in the shortest
amount of time.

The game rules are as follows:

1. The game begins with 1 Hatchery, 1 Overlord, and 5 Drones.
2. Hatcheries can produce Drones, Overlords and Zerglings at a rate of 1 unit
   per second.
3. Drones collect 8 minerals per second. Drones can be used to build either
   Hatcheries or Spawning Pools. Buildings are built instantaneously and the
   drone used is lost in the process.
4. There must be 1 Overlord per 8 units. Only the number of drones and the
   number of Zerglings contribute to the unit count.
5. Zerglings can only be produced if a Spawning Pool exists.
6. You are only allowed to have up to 200 units during a game.

The unit costs are shown below.

| Unit          | Mineral Cost  |
